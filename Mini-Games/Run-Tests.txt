/* TODO: Create a md file and update with how to create tests, etc */

A small explanation/ reminder on running the tests. Based on GoogleTest

# in a shell terminal
cd <repo containing CMakeLists.txt>

# set up the build directory
cmake -S . -B build

# build tests
cmake --build build

# enter directory and then run the tests
cd build && ctest
